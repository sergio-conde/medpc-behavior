# behavior_medpc
Utility functions to read and process MedPC output files in MATLAB and Python

This repository is mainly developed for behavioural neuroscience experiments using Med Associates equipment, but the functions are intended to be reusable across different projects and labs.

## Features

- Read raw MedPC output files into MATLAB and Python structures.
- Parse sessions and extract trial-by-trial data.
- Basic utilities to clean and organize MedPC data for further analysis.

*(Note: This project is under active development and the API may change.)*
